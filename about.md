                <p>I have worked as a web designer and developer since 2010.  I became interested in web development while working for Boeing's Usability Services group, but quickly discovered that designing and conducting user research wasn't satisfying enough for me&ndash;I wanted to actually build the site.</p>
                <p>Since then, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from an intranet search engine to eCommerce.  I've strived to keep a pulse on the modern trends of web development, both to deliver the best possible experience for users as well as to make life easier as a developer.</p>
                <p>I live near Seattle, WA with my wife and two sons.  I enjoy riding my bike to work, hiking with the Boy Scout troop I volunteer with, and spending quality time with my family.</p>

                <h3>Jekyll + Github Pages</h3>
                <p>I decided to use a static HTML generator as the framework for this site.  Github pages provides a robust set of tools for automatically building a project built in Jekyll, and it works perfectly for something static, like a portfolio.</p>
                <p>I've used static generators like Jekyll, Hyde, and Wok for years now when working on sites with static content.  They provide the ability to reuse components, build macros, and do other things that make a site much easier to maintain.  As I've gained experience with these frameworks, it has become easier to pick up server-side frameworks that are built in a very similar way.</p>
                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>I &hearts; Bootstrap. I've used Bootstrap on nearly every project I've worked on since version 2, and it is amazing. While I've mostly seen it used in the wild for quick-and-dirty documentation sites, I have used it almost exclusively as a starting point for creating custom designs.</p>
                <p>The approach I typically take to creating custom designs with Bootstrap is to add override LESS files which are compiled into a single stylesheet. This approach has worked out very nicely, and ensures that I can update the core Bootstrap files fairly easily without losing all of my customizations.</p>
