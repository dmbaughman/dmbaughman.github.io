Search 3.1 was intended as the front-end for our new search engine, but it took so long for our infrastructure to be put in place that I ended up re-designing it before it could be implemented.

This was the first responsive design that I will claim ownership for (search 3.0 was a hodgepodge of experiments in responsive/adaptive layout).  I designed the homepage (shown) to be like a marketing site for our service, with the idea of showcasing the improvements we were making to Search.
