This is the consumer-facing website I built while at Softcard (formerly Isis).  Its main function is to introduce the product (a mobile wallet) and help users know how to get started with the app (which has quite a few prerequisite requirements).

I built my local dev environment using Hyde (a Python static site generator) and the UI framework is built on Bootstrap 3.  I also began using Grunt to manage my build process, which greatly simplified the day-to-day development tasks of compiling assets and building the site.
