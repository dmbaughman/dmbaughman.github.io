Search 2.0 was the first re-design I did for Enterprise Search a few months after joining the group.  Prior to this, the search landing page our user/developer reference materials were completely separate, so it was difficult for users to get self-help on everyday topics.

The previous landing page was completely different from the rest of the site, so it was unclear that it was even the same site.  This design is simple, and was aimed at creating a more unified web presence for Enterprise Search.
