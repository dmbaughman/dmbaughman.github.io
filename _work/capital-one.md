I arrived at Capital One Investing just weeks before they received a master brand refresh for the entire company called "One Design".  At the time, they didn't have a CSS framework to use across their web properties, and the result was a lot of design inconsistency from one place to the next.  So I applied the knowledge and experience I had gained by working on the CSS framework at REI, I immediately began building a CSS framework that incorporated the master brand elements into a comprehensive set of styles that other developers could use.  I used this framework on my projects, as well as a talking point to evangelize the idea of having a shared style framework for all the product teams to use.
