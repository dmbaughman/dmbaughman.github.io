When I arrived at Capital One Investing, they didn't have a CSS framework to use across their web properties and the result was a lot of design inconsistency from one place to the next.  So I applied the knowledge and experience I had gained by working on the CSS framework at REI, I immediately began building a CSS framework that incorporated the master brand elements into a comprehensive set of styles that other developers could use.  I used this framework on my projects for the marketing team, and shared it with designers and developers to promote the idea of sharing a core style framework across organizations.

I built the framework on top of Bootstrap and added a simple documentation site for developers to use for quick reference.  I also added NPM support so other teams could use the framework as a dependency in their existing front-end build processes.
