Search 3.3 improved on the visual design of Search 3.1.  Instead of using the homepage almost exclusively as marketing space, I decided to put whitespace around the search box so that functionality retained its precedence on the site.

The reference materials on the previous site had way too much information and were rarely used, so I reduced those materials to 4 pages.  Each of these pages has a clean sub-navigation to quickly jump to the high-level topic of interest for more details.
