My primary role at IMS Health is to build a CSS framework that implements the company-branded components and patterns.  I relied heavily on the markup and naming conventions from Bootstrap, but only used a few parts from Bootstrap itself (e.g. variables, grid, utilities).  I created a custom documentation site as part of the project using Jekyll, which includes several different layouts for code examples and concept illustrations.

These are screenshots from the documentation site I made to accompany the framework, as well as a prototype I helped build as a demo of how the framework can be used.  This prototype was used for a demo at a company conference and was very well received.
