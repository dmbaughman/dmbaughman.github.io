I was hired by IMS Health to build a CSS framework that implements the Apollo design language for developers throughout the company to use.  I patterned the code after the markup and naming conventions from Bootstrap, but only used a few parts from Bootstrap itself (e.g. variables, grid, utilities).  The result is a custom CSS framework that uses markup that is very familiar and comfortable to many developers, but with styles that are unique to IMS Health.  I created a custom documentation site as part of the project using Jekyll, which includes several different layouts for code examples and concept illustrations.

As I was nearing completion of the framework itself, I was asked to help build a prototype to demonstrate what an application could look like with the Apollo styles applied.  I'm happy to say that we (myself and another developer) were able to build the prototype in just a few weeks.  The quick turnaround was great indicator to me that the framework I had built was easy to use and provided the majority of what developers would need to create an application that applied the new branded components.
