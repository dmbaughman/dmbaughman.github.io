During my time at REI, I have built several customer-facing features and pages, including the mobile site off-canvas navigation, the mobile user account pages, and the outdoor school search results page.  I arrived at REI just before they began to work on a new in-house mobile website and so I was part of that exciting project to create the new mobile experience for rei.com customers.

As I worked on the mobile site, quickly noticed that there was a need for an icon set for everyone to use across the site.  So I worked with designers to create and implement an icon font that provided a tool for both designers and developers to use.  I added this icon font to the fledgling UI framework that was built to support the mobile website project, and I later helped maintain both the codebase and documentation for that framework.  As REI is working on doing a complete site redesign, I'm helping lead the development of the new UI framework and its accompanying documentation.

At REI, and throughout my career, I have worked closely with Ix and UX designers to build several high-fidelity prototypes for use in usability tests.  I am a huge advocate of qualitative research methods and have first-hand experience creating and conducting usability studies to validate my own designs.  I absolutely love working on visual designs, and especially working with talented designers to make their designs come to life on a variety of form factors.
