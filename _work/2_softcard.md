This is the consumer-facing website I built while at Softcard.  Its main function is to introduce the product (a mobile wallet) and help users know how to get started with the app (which has quite a few prerequisite requirements).

I built my local dev environment using Hyde (a Python clone of Jekyll) and the UI framework is none other than the latest and greatest version of Bootstrap 3.  I also began using Grunt (NodeJS) to manage my build process, which is amazingly awesome at what it does.

I can't take complete credit for the homepage design, which was largely done by a member of Softcard's product design team, but I took the design he came up with for the homepage and used it to create a design pattern to follow for the rest of the pages on the site.

Since leaving Softcard, many of the visual elements of the site have changed, but the underlying framework I built is still being put to good use. =)
