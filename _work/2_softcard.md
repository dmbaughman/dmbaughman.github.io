This is the consumer-facing website I built while at Softcard (formerly Isis).  Its main function is to introduce the product (a mobile wallet) and help users know how to get started with the app (which has quite a few prerequisite requirements).

I built my local dev environment using Hyde (a Python clone of Jekyll) and the UI framework is none other than the latest and greatest version of Bootstrap 3.  I also began using Grunt (NodeJS) to manage my build process, which is amazingly awesome at what it does.

I can't take complete credit for the homepage design, which was largely done by a member of Softcard's product design team, but I took the design he came up with for the homepage and used it to create a design pattern to follow for the rest of the pages on the site.

Since leaving Softcard, many of the visual elements of the site have changed, but the underlying framework I built is still being put to good use. =)
