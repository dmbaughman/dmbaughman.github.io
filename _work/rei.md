During my time at REI, I built several customer-facing features and pages, including the mobile navigation menu, the mobile user account pages, and the outdoor school search results page.  I arrived at REI just before they began to work on a new in-house mobile website and so I was part of that exciting project to create the new mobile experience for rei.com customers.

As I worked on the mobile site, I quickly realized that there was a need for an icon set to use across the site.  So I worked with designers to create and implement an icon font that provided a tool for both designers and developers to use.  I added this icon font to the fledgling UI framework that was built to support the mobile website project, and I later joined the team that maintains both the codebase and documentation for that framework.  As REI is working on doing a complete site redesign, I'm leading the development for the new UI framework and its accompanying documentation.
