One of my proudest accomplishments was replacing 7 different implementations of the login page with a single modern login application built with Preact. Centralizing and modernizing this application has made it possible to quickly iterate on improvments to the login experience, including the addition of social login and A/B testing placement of the secondary login buttons.

In addition to supporting my core team, I also volunteered to help build and maintain the internal React component library that is used by the front-end teams across the company.  The library was in a neglected state when I joined. After identifying a variety of problems with lack of consistency and the need for standardization, I helped implement patterns and processes that have helped get the library into a much better state and ensure its longevity long-term.  Some examples of improvements we made to the library include introducing compound components, improving component test coverage to 100%, and implementing standardized documentation.
