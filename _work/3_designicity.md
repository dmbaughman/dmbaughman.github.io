This is my first *real* freelance project for a friend I grew up with.  She's an interior designer in New York, and this site is designed as a quasi-blog which she uses to promote products she sells for other companies.

The core of the site (especially the blog) uses Wok, a Python-based static HTML generator similar to Hyde.  Wok uses a combination of Jinja2 templates for generating the page structure, and Markdown for page content.  The base CSS is built using a customized version of Bootstrap.

A special thanks to [Rob McGuire-Dale](http://robmd.net/) for referring me to Wok, and helping me learn how to use it effectively.
