<h1>Work</h1>
<p class="lead">I am passionate about writing clean, reusable code to craft web experiences that work well for users.  I love using tools like LESS and SASS to make stylesheets modular and improve code maintenance.  And when it comes to writing markup, I'm a big fan of templating languages like Jinja and Nunjucks, which allow me to assemble pages using modular, reusable components.</p>
