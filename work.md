<h1>Work</h1>
<p class="lead">I currently work as a front-end developer for <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI.com</a> in the Seattle area.  I am most passionate about HTML and CSS and have been working to strengthen my JavaScript skills.  For CSS I love using tools like LESS and SASS to make stylesheets modular and improve code maintenance.  And for HTML, I'm a big fan of templating languages like Jinja and Nunjucks which allow me to create markup using modular, reusable components.</p>
