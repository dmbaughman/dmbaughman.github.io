<h1>Work</h1>

<p>I am passionate about writing clean, reusable code to craft web experiences that work well for users.  I love writing reusable code for all aspects of front-end development, whether it's reusable components for React or Angular, mixins and CSS frameworks written in SASS, or partials and includes for static-site generators like Jekyll.  So regardless of what project I'm working on, I always look for a way to modularize my code so I can make my work easier to maintain and share efficiencies with my team.</p>
